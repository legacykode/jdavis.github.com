<h2 id="about">About <i class="icon-double-angle-right"></i></h2>
<p class="greeting">
    My name is Agung Setiawan.
</p>

<p>
    I'm a
    <a href="{{ site.data.accounts.github.site }}">software engineer</a>
    at <a href="http://www.bukalapk.com/">BukaLapak</a>
    and a .NET developer turned Rubyist on early 2016, so yeah I'm a noob.
</p>

<p>
    I love book so much and can't resist to buy it when I'm on a bookstore, even I still have so many unread books on my shelf. For me <b>Book is Love, Book is Life</b>.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Legacykode</b> is my personal website in English I'm using mainly for learning English, yes. Without good knowledge in English life as software engineer is sucks. If you find a strange sentence in this website that's because... ah you know it.

    Other than that, this website is my online presence in this big, big world of software engineering. At least, people in other side of the world (<i>read: :usa</i>) will know my name (haha!).
